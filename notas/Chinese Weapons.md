# Organization and weapons of the People's Liberation Army

Weapons are not the most important factor. Leadership, motivation, weather, terrain, electromagnetic spectrum and so on all have a very strong influence. The quality of the **soldier** is almost always superior to the quality of the weapon; weapon systems must be understood in a **social** context.

+ **PLAN:** China deploys their army forces in military regions that consist in a number of army bases. 
+ **PLAAF:** The People's Liberation Army Air Force is deployed in its own military regions, in 105 air bases.
+ **PLAN:** The People's Liberation Army Navy is deployed in three ports: *Qingdao*, *Dinghai* and *Zhan Jiang*.

There aproximately 2 milion people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Second Artillery Division (nuclear weapons branch).

+ Army: 1.6m (800k conscripts; 2 years service)
+ Navy: 255k (40k conscripts; 2 years service)
+ Air Force: 330k
+ Strategic Missile Force: 100k

Most conscripts are volunteers. There is a strong declining Party membership inside the PLA. The National Defense Reserve Force is also in decline.

An important aspect of training are training assets, of which China has plenty, including simulated environments.

The ranks include officer commanders and an NCO corp that leads and trains the non-commissioned forces. Ranks are *specialized* in different aspects: lower ranks do more technical work, and higher raks tend to deal with staff work. Higher ranking officers usually do not carry firearms.
