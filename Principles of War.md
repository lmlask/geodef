We organize the analysis of the outcomes of victory and defeat through the principles of war. Humans have been involved in organized violence for a very long time. Political context matters in all warfare. It is analysed through three different "levels", roughly arbitrary, but useful for our purposes.

# Levels of Analysis

## Strategic

This is the balancing of political goals and military resources. Seeking less than the resources allow is effectively wasting strenght; seeking goals defended by those stronger than you is inviting defeat.

Clausewitz explains that "war is policy by other means". Hence, it is mediated by political goals. The soldiers are paid and the equipment is bought by citizens and leaders; the objectives of a war are defined by politics. Because of this, we do not have endless wars. Wars are started and ended by political goals.

Wars can alter goals. In the process of the fighting, widening and reducing goals is constant and common. 

>In world war two, Japan's goals were to control China and Southeast Asia to secure resources and as a buffer against US action, and then to negotiate for peace.

## Operational

The operational level focuses on formations at a level at which weapons ranges and deployments are abstracted. At this level we're interested in breakthrough, encirclement and flanking maneuvers; the unit sizes are typically thousands of soldiers and more.

## Tactical

This is concerned with the territorial deployment of weapons. Unit sizes are typically hundreds and less. The tactics of maneuvering each unit as to support each other are analysed here.
